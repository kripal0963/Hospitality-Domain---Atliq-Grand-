This project is part of the CodeBasics September Month Resume Challenge. The goal was to create a comprehensive data-driven analysis for a luxury hotel chain using Power BI.

# Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for 20 years. Due to strong competition and suboptimal management decisions, the company is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment.

To regain its position, the managing director decided to implement Business and Data Intelligence but lacks an in-house data analytics team.

Objective: Provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations using historical data.

# Task List

As a Data Analyst, the tasks included:

Creating metrics as per the provided metric list.

Developing a dashboard according to the stakeholder mock-up.

Creating additional insights beyond the provided mock-up dashboard.

# Provided Resources:

Mock-up Dashboard

Data Model

Key Learnings from the Project

Built a Calendar Visual using a matrix table for flexible analysis.

# Understood hotel cancellation policies:

Most hotels charge zero fee if cancelled 3 months prior to booking.

After 3 months, charges range from 60–90% of booking cost.

Learned bookmarks and selection features in Power BI to create page navigation and clear filter functionality.
